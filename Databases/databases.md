# SQL vs NoSQL Databases

## In Summary:

| **Criteria**              | **SQL Databases**                                 | **NoSQL Databases**                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**         | Structured, predefined schema                    | Flexible, dynamic schema                          |
| **Scalability**            | Vertical scaling (upgrading hardware)            | Horizontal scaling (distributing across nodes)    |
| **Consistency**            | ACID-compliant, strong consistency               | Eventual consistency, relaxed consistency         |
| **Query Complexity**       | Supports complex queries (joins, aggregations)   | Simpler queries, limited support for complex queries|
| **Relationships**          | Strong support for complex relationships (joins)| Limited support for relationships                 |
| **Development Speed**      | Slower schema changes, rigid structure           | Faster development, flexible data model           |
| **Use Cases**              | Financial apps, transactional systems, CRM, ERP | Web apps, big data, real-time analytics, IoT      |

## When to Choose SQL:
- When you need strong data consistency (e.g., in banking, finance).
- When your data is highly structured with well-defined relationships.
- When your system requires complex queries and transactions (e.g., joins, reporting).

## When to Choose NoSQL:
- When you need to scale horizontally across many servers (e.g., high-traffic web apps).
- When your data structure is flexible or doesn't fit neatly into tables (e.g., documents, JSON).
- When your app deals with unstructured or semi-structured data, like social media posts or sensor data.
- When you can tolerate eventual consistency (e.g., logging, analytics).

## ACID Explained

**ACID** stands for the four key properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably. These properties are:

- **Atomicity**: 
  - Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left in a consistent state.
  
- **Consistency**: 
  - Guarantees that a transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another, ensuring that all data integrity constraints (e.g., rules, relationships) are satisfied before and after the transaction.
  
- **Isolation**: 
  - Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from each other. Even if multiple transactions are occurring at the same time, each transaction will execute as if it were the only one running, preventing data corruption.
  
- **Durability**: 
  - Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of system crashes or power failures. The results of the transaction are permanently stored.

These four properties are crucial for applications that require reliable, secure, and consistent data management (e.g., banking, financial applications).
