# System Architecture for Web Platform with 30,000 Active Users

This document outlines a scalable and reliable system architecture for a web platform serving 30,000 active users.

## 1. Overview
The architecture is designed to handle functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring performance, scalability, and reliability.

## 2. High-Level Architecture Components
### Frontend
- Framework: **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js**
- Static assets served via **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** for fast load times.

### Backend
- Microservices architecture with **containerization** (Docker) and orchestration (**Kubernetes**) for scalability.
- REST/GraphQL APIs to serve client requests.

### Database
- Relational Database: **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for structured data.
- NoSQL Database: **MongoDB** or **DynamoDB** for unstructured data.
- **Read replicas** for scaling read-heavy operations.

### Caching
- Use **Redis** or **Memcached** to cache frequently accessed data.

### Load Balancer
- **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** or **NGINX** for traffic distribution.

### Storage
- Static files stored in **Amazon S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**.

### Monitoring & Logging
- Monitoring: **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
- Logging: **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Splunk**.

## 3. Scalability and Reliability
- **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more instances of application servers during peak usage.
- **Auto-scaling**: Cloud provider services to dynamically scale resources.
- **Database sharding**: To handle larger volumes of data.
- **Rate limiting**: Preventing abuse by limiting API requests per user.

## 4. Deployment Plan
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: To minimize downtime during updates.

| Relational DB      | PostgreSQL, MySQL             |
| NoSQL DB           | MongoDB, DynamoDB             |
| Storage            | Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage|
| Load Balancer      | AWS ELB, NGINX                |
| Monitoring         | Prometheus, Grafana           |
| Logging            | ELK Stack, Splunk             |

## 7. Conclusion
This architecture is scalable, robust, and prepared to handle the demands of 30,000 active users with high availability and low latency.
