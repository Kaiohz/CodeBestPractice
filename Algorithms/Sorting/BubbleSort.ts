Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in worst and average cases, O(n) in best case
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable: Yes
In-place: Yes

Explanation:
1. Bubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list
2. Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
3. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed
4. In each iteration, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position
5. The optimization with 'swapped' flag helps to exit early if array is already sorted
