Question 1:

Imagine you have a Node.js/TypeScript project that needs to fetch data from an external API. How would you structure your code to handle this task in a clean and maintainable way?

Bonus: What would you consider if the API rate limits requests?

Caching: Implement caching strategies to store frequently accessed data and reduce API calls.
Handle Rate Limit Errors: Detect rate limit errors and handle them gracefully, such as retrying requests with exponential backoff.
